# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. This project is currently being implemented as part of my data engineering portfolio.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Baraa Khatib Salkini** (**Data With Baraa**). This project is built following his expert curriculum and architectural framework. His guidance on Medallion Architecture and SQL best practices has been foundational for this implementation.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture (In Progress)

The data architecture for this project follows the Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into a SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

*Note: Architecture diagrams and visual data flows are currently under development.*
